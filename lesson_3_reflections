When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

- if I work on another PC
- if I want to commit something to a repository that someone else has created

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because several people might want to work on the repo in parallel
