Using diff to find bugs

Why?
I do not have to go through two different files line by line
comparing the lines. Differences are shown to me immediately.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
- Being able to compare different software versions
- Merging versions that colleagues have been working on

Version control system

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions
automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
- Versions are then just saved whenever changes are singnificant
- No risk that some changes are lost as manual control

git diff df035382c41b4d0cda86a1aa30b53f15bef05b53 df035382c41b4d0cda86a1aa30b53f15bef05b53

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log shows all the commits
git diff compares the commits

checkout commit--> restore this version

How might using version control make you more confident to make
changes that could break something?
Because it's easier to find the previous versions without bugs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Checking in a new commit for proto messages
