What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

the repository is transformed to a git repository; Otherwise I cannot commit changes and the history of files is not recorded

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a collection place for all files that should be contained in the commit; 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
If I do not put too many changes into the staging area

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I am not sure if a change makes sense; in case of experimental changes; if I need different versions because of different languages etc.
