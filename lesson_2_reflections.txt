What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

the repository is transformed to a git repository; Otherwise I cannot commit changes and the history of files is not recorded

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It is a collection place for all files that should be contained in the commit;
